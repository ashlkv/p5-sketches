    <title>Totalistic cellular automata</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The rule is set up so that the new color of every cell is determined by the average of the previous colors of the cell and its immediate neighbors. With 0 representing white, 1 gray and 2 black, the rightmost element of the rule gives the result for average color 0, while the element immediately to its left gives the result for average color 1/3â€”and so on. Interpreting the sequence of new colors as a sequence of base 3 digits, one can assign a code number to each totalistic rule.">
